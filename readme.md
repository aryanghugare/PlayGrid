## 📊 Data Modeling

PlayGrid follows a **well-structured database design** to ensure optimal performance and scalability. The data model includes relationships between users, videos, subscriptions, likes, comments, and watch history.

**Key Relationships:**
- **Users** can upload multiple **Videos** and have **Subscriptions**
- **Videos** contain metadata, thumbnails, and are linked to **Likes** and **Comments**
- **Watch History** tracks user interactions for personalized recommendations
- **Subscriptions** enable users to follow channels and creators
- **Tweet-like Posts** for social interaction and community engagement

This normalized database structure ensures data integrity while maintaining high performance for complex queries and real-time operations.

## Implementation and local development

The backend has been extended and a React frontend is available in `frontend/`. The original backend learning comments are retained. See [backend additions and API contracts](docs/BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md) and [frontend setup](frontend/README.md).

Quick local start after installing dependencies: `npm run build --prefix frontend`, then `npm run dev:local`. Open `http://localhost:8000`, create an account, and upload your first video. This optional mode keeps a development database and media in `data/` and does not use your existing `.env` credentials. Use the original `npm run dev` command for your configured backend.

Checks: `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e --prefix frontend`.
